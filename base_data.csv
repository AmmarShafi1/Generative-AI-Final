"Context: The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even
realize at first that they're startup ideas. This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Instead of making a conscious'?
Answer:","Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort"
"Context:  About 20% of the
startups we've funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so often
that we've reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don't require
it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly
way for people to quit. A founder leaving doesn't necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plenty
of successful startups have had that happen. [ 11 ] Fortunately it's
usually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are three
founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you have
two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves,
that's more of a problem.  But even that is survivable.  Blogger
got down to one person, and they bounced back

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'We still don't require it,'?
Answer:","We still don't require
it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly
way for people to quit"
"Context:  For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever
had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.
Thousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world's infrastructure?  Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea
of fixing payments. Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking ""should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?"" and chose the recipe site

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Probably no one who applied'?
Answer:","Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking ""should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?"" and chose the recipe site"
"Context: Afterward
you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design  
of another part of the program, and so on.
Language and program evolve together.
Like the border between two warring states,
the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,
until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,
the natural frontiers of your problem.
In the end your program will look as if the language had been
designed for it.
And when language and
program fit one another well, you end up with code which is
clear, small, and efficient. It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean
just writing the same program in a different order

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up'?
Answer:","It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean
just writing the same program in a different order"
"Context:  He walks right by them, dressed up as an
old man on crutches, and they never suspect him. Our secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weird
AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For years
it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now it
worked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuable
than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand.  In
business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force. And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything
publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'In business, as in war,'?
Answer:","In
business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force"
"Context:  If a filter has never seen the
token ""xxxporn"" before it will have an individual spam
probability of .4, whereas ""xxx"" and ""porn"" individually
have probabilities (in my corpus) of .9889 and .99
respectively, and a combined probability of .9998. I expect decomposing domain names to become more
important as spammers are gradually forced to stop using
incriminating words in the text of their messages.  (A url
with an ip address is of course an extremely incriminating sign,
except in the mail of a few sysadmins.) It might be a good idea to have a cooperatively maintained
list of urls promoted by spammers

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about '4, whereas ""xxx"" and ""porn""'?
Answer:","4, whereas ""xxx"" and ""porn"" individually
have probabilities (in my corpus) of"
"Context: At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company
initially, because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer
to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up. 
But we never charged for such work, because we didn't want them to
start treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every
time they wanted something changed on their site.  We knew we had
to stay a product company, because only
that scales. 8. Avoid inexperienced investors. Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most
dangerous sort, because they're so nervous.  Especially in
proportion to the amount they invest

Answer:","Especially in
proportion to the amount they invest"
"Context: Thanks to Sarah Harlin for reading drafts of this; Daniel Giffin (who is 
also writing the production Arc interpreter) for several good ideas about
filtering and for creating our mail infrastructure; Robert Morris,

"Context: [ 2 ] In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing
angel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,
then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they
could, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs.  One reason
startups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious.
But if angel investors become more active and better known, they'll
increasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand. Of course, prestige isn't the main reason to prefer a series A
round.  A startup will probably get more attention from investors
in a series A round than an angel round

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'One reason startups prefer series'?
Answer:","One reason
startups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious"
"Context:  But adding this ability
to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper.  The result is
bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal. A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make,
is extraordinarily powerful.  And not just at making money: look
what a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox. Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the
same way that not drinking anything would teach you how much you
depend on water.  But it would be more convenient for all involved
if the Summer Founders didn't learn this on our dime—if they could
skip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers
wanted

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A hacker who has learned'?
Answer:","A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make,
is extraordinarily powerful"
"Context:  The
Pebbles assembled the first several hundred watches themselves. If
they hadn't gone through that phase, they probably wouldn't have
sold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter. Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating
things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.
You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, and you
learn things you'd never have known otherwise

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'The Pebbles assembled the first'?
Answer:","The
Pebbles assembled the first several hundred watches themselves"
"Context: Bring Back Moore's Law The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore's Law actually says.
Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising that
clock speeds would double every 18 months.  Actually what it says
is that circuit densities will double every 18 months.  It used to
seem pedantic to point that out.  Not any more.  Intel can no longer
give us faster CPUs, just more of them. This Moore's Law is not as good as the old one

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Bring Back Moore's Law The'?
Answer:",Bring Back Moore's Law The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore's Law actually says
"Context:  But in general, for
application software, you want to be using the most powerful
(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything
else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a
lesser degree, as programming in machine language. You can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at least
as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all
treated as equivalent.  They're not.  Technically the term ""high-level
language"" doesn't mean anything very definite.  There's no dividing
line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level
languages on the other

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'You can see that machine'?
Answer:",You can see that machine language is very low level
"Context:  You can find groups near you through the Angel Capital Association . [ 3 ] However, most angel investors don't belong to these groups.  In
fact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to
belong to a group. Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them.
Needless to say, you should never do this. One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels,
rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they
have less reputation to protect.  A big-name VC firm will not screw
you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if
word got out.  With individual angels you don't have this protection,
as we found to our dismay in our own startup

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A big-name VC firm will'?
Answer:","A big-name VC firm will not screw
you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if
word got out"
"Context:  So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take
money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are
willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation.  For
example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible
note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped
at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think. [ 3 ] The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next
equity round.  And ""no convincing"" means just that: zero time spent
meeting with investors or preparing materials for them

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'So when you're not in'?
Answer:","So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take
money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are
willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation"
"Context: How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something
to solve your own problems , then
you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.
Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate
the most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is to
get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted
launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and
seek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that
a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,
so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and
that worked well

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'How do you find users'?
Answer:","How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something
to solve your own problems , then
you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward"
"Context:  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become.  There
may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,
so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the
answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars. The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure
they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few,
artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'I learned to keep a'?
Answer:","I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars"
"Context: I explained this as code to show a couple of important details.
I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid false
positives, and by trial and error I've found that a good
way to do it is to double all the numbers in good .
This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally
do occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. 
I only consider words that occur more than five times in
total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three 
times in nonspam mail would be enough).  And then there is
the question of what probability to assign to words that
occur in one corpus but not the other.  Again by trial and   
error I chose .01 and .99

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'I explained this as code'?
Answer:",I explained this as code to show a couple of important details
"Context:  The question is not whether
you need it, but whether it brings any advantage at all.
Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors
an advantage over you if they do it and you don't.  So if you hear
someone saying ""we don't need to be in Silicon Valley,"" that use
of the word ""need"" is a sign they're not even thinking about the
question right. And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing
cheapness of starting a startup means the particles they're attracting
are getting lighter.  A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year
old guys.  A company like that can move much more easily than one
with 10 people, half of whom have kids

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A company like that can'?
Answer:","A company like that can move much more easily than one
with 10 people, half of whom have kids"
"Context:  There are plenty of people
as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing. In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent. I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but
the relative importance of determination and talent probably do
vary somewhat.  Talent probably matters more in types of work that
are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type
of problem instead of many different types

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'In most domains, talent is'?
Answer:","In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent"
"Context:  If you find yourself saying a sentence that
ends with ""but we're going to keep working on the startup,"" you are
in big trouble.  Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to
keep working on the startup.  We're moving back to Minnesota, but
we're going to keep working on the startup.  We're taking on some
consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup.
You may as well just translate these to ""we're giving up on the
startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves,"" because
that's what it means most of the time.  A startup is so hard that
working on it can't be preceded by ""but."" In particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other
projects

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A startup is so hard'?
Answer:","A startup is so hard that
working on it can't be preceded by ""but"
"Context: In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix.  I dragged him
into it. [ 3 ] But there were moments when he was optimistic.  And
if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such
a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers
aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money. The Still Life Effect Why does this happen?  Why do good hackers have bad business ideas? Let's look at our case.  One reason we had such a lame idea was
that it was the first thing we thought of.  I was in New York trying
to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually
quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about '[ 3 ] But there'?
Answer:",[ 3 ] But there were moments when he was optimistic
"Context:  And then a second later I realized that without
Julian, Viaweb would never have made it.  So even though it was a
good deal for him, it was a good deal for us too.  That's why I
knew there was room for something like Y Combinator. Initially we didn't have what turned out to be the most important
idea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as
it had always been done before.  Or rather we had the idea, but we
didn't realize its significance.  We decided very early 
that the first thing we'd do would
be to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer.  But we
didn't realize initially that this would be the way we'd do all our
investing

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Initially we didn't have what'?
Answer:","Initially we didn't have what turned out to be the most important
idea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as
it had always been done before"
"Context:  Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better. Jerry didn't seem to care.  I was confused.  I was showing him
technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,
and he didn't care?  I couldn't tell whether I was explaining it
badly, or he was just very poker faced. I didn't realize the answer till later, after I went to work at
Yahoo.  It was neither of my guesses.  The reason Yahoo didn't care
about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that
advertisers were already overpaying for it.  If Yahoo merely extracted
the actual value, they'd have made less

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Users train the search: you'?
Answer:","Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better"
"Context:  Python copies even features
that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes.
You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line.
It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up 
with 1958. Catching Up with Math What I mean is that
Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958,
and popular programming languages are only now
catching up with the ideas he developed then. Now, how could that be true?  Isn't computer technology something
that changes very rapidly?  I mean, in 1958, computers were
refrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of    
a wristwatch

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Now, how could that be'?
Answer:","Now, how could that be true?  Isn't computer technology something
that changes very rapidly?  I mean, in 1958, computers were
refrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of    
a wristwatch"
"Context: [ 6 ] Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turned
down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations
were too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.
But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble
about valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returns
come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far
more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them? After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other
signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be
smarter than they seem

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'This was not a problem'?
Answer:","This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it"
"Context:   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.
Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their
head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just
that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee
wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due
partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  ""Perfect'' eyesight
means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley
had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.
Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by
using a very dense language, 
which shrinks the court.) This could explain the disconnect over cubicles

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about '""Perfect'' eyesight means about 47'?
Answer:","""Perfect'' eyesight
means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision"
"Context:  And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely
to notice and complain. But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when 
you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley
and put them in a boat together.  They will have all
the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.
But more importantly, by selecting that small a group
you can get the best rowers.  Each one will be in
the top 1%.  It's a much better deal for them to average  
their work together with a small group of their peers than to    
average it with everyone. That's the real point of startups

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Each one will be in'?
Answer:","Each one will be in
the top 1%"
"Context:  You're committing to search for one
of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.  Because these ideas
are so valuable, finding one is hard.  The startup is the embodiment
of your discoveries so far.  Starting a startup is thus very much
like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to
solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems
are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no
one knew before.  A startup founder is in effect an economic research
scientist.  Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some
discover relativity

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Starting a startup is thus'?
Answer:","Starting a startup is thus very much
like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to
solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems
are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no
one knew before"
"Context: March 2007 (This essay is derived from talks at the 2007 
Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.) We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates.  Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had
eight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at least
four succeeded.  Three have been acquired: Reddit was a merger of
two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't
talk about yet.  Another from that batch was Loopt , which is doing
so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if
they wanted to. So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two
years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about ') We've now been doing'?
Answer:",") We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates"
"Context:  Nearly every startup
that fails, fails by running out of money.  It's a little misleading
to put it this way, because there's usually some other underlying
cause.  But regardless of the source of your problems, a low burn
rate gives you more opportunity to recover from them.  And since
most startups make all kinds of mistakes at first, room to recover
from mistakes is a valuable thing to have. Most startups end up doing something different than they planned.
The way the successful ones find something that works is by trying
things that don't.  So the worst thing you can do in a startup is
to have a rigid, pre-ordained plan and then start spending a lot
of money to implement it

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'The way the successful ones'?
Answer:","The way the successful ones find something that works is by trying
things that don't"
"Context: In the future, angel rounds will less often be for specific amounts
or have a lead investor.  In the old days, the standard m.o. for
startups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You'd
negotiate a round size and valuation with the lead, who'd supply
some but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead would
cooperate to find the rest. The future of angel rounds looks more like this: instead of a fixed
round size, startups will do a rolling close, where they take money
from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Then the startup and the'?
Answer:","Then the startup and the lead would
cooperate to find the rest"
"Context:  In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer
of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their
applications.  But there was one who was away half the time talking
to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals.
Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker? [ 10 ] But it
paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that
group by an order of magnitude. If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you
can't just hack.  At least one hacker will have to spend some of
the time doing business stuff. 17. Fights Between Founders Fights between founders are surprisingly common

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'In the first batch of'?
Answer:","In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer
of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their
applications"
"Context:  But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is
that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking
it's time to buy.  You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and
by definition only a minority of investors can be. So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying
to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be
reluctant to invest even in good ones. You'll have to adapt to this.  But that's nothing new: startups
always have to adapt to the whims of investors.  Ask any founder
in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch
the face they make.  Last year you had to be prepared to explain
how your startup was viral

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'But that's nothing new: startups'?
Answer:","But that's nothing new: startups
always have to adapt to the whims of investors"
"Context: If you think about famous startups, it's pretty clear how big a
role luck plays.  Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an
exclusive license for DOS? Why are founders fooled by this?  Business guys probably aren't,
but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you
get what you deserve. When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup
    founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some
    ways.  Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all
    hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient. Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the product of skill, determination, and luck

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'So is being determined as'?
Answer:","So is being determined as all
    hell"
"Context: The combined code can be much shorter than if you
had written your whole program in the base language-- indeed,
this is how most compression algorithms work.
A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as well,  
because in many cases the language layer won't have to change
at all

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'The combined code can be'?
Answer:","The combined code can be much shorter than if you
had written your whole program in the base language-- indeed,
this is how most compression algorithms work"
"Context:  It
seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists
and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors
and whose parents want them to be novelists.  The kids think their
parents are ""materialistic."" Not necessarily.  All parents tend to
be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves,
simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.  If
your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage
daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share
in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets
pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If your eight year old'?
Answer:","If
your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage
daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share
in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets
pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences"
"Context: That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors. [ 1 ] You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say ""I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."" If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you

slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it

Answer:","Later when

but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive"
"Context: In an essay I wrote a couple years ago 
I advised graduating seniors
to work for a couple years for another company before starting their
own.  I'd modify that now.  Work for another company if you want
to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own
startup, go ahead. The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately
was that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious
programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than
going to work at a big company.  Certainly they'll learn more.  They
might even be better off financially

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'In an essay I wrote'?
Answer:","In an essay I wrote a couple years ago 
I advised graduating seniors

"Context: In fact, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups
that could succeed.  Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is
the satisfaction of people's desires.  And people's desires seem
to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term. What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won't
be able to sit on a good idea.  Other people have your idea, and
they'll be increasingly likely to do something about it. 10. Faster Advances There's a good side to that, at least for consumers of
technology.  If people get right to work implementing ideas instead
of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If people get right to'?
Answer:","If people get right to work implementing ideas instead
of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster"
"Context: I suspect VCs accept business plans ""over the transom"" more as a
way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals.  In
fact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan
randomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness.
Do the extra work of getting personal introductions.  As one VC put
it: I'm not hard to find.  I know a lot of people.  If you can't find
  some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful
  company? One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding
when to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because they
rely heavily on first impressions

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'I suspect VCs accept business'?
Answer:","I suspect VCs accept business plans ""over the transom"" more as a
way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals"
"Context:  ""Business plan"" has that word ""business"" in
it, so I figured it had to be something I'd have to read a book
about business plans to write.  Well, it doesn't.  At this stage,
all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan    
to do and how you're going to make money from it, and the resumes 
of the founders.  If you just sit down and write out what you've
been saying to one another, that should be fine.  It shouldn't take
more than a couple hours, and you'll probably find that writing it
all down gives you more ideas about what to do. For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you're going
to have to have some kind of company.  Merely incorporating yourselves
isn't hard

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'For the angel to have'?
Answer:","For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you're going
to have to have some kind of company"
"Context: We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken
when we started Viaweb.  We started Viaweb with $10k we got from
our friend Julian Weber ,
the husband of Idelle Weber, whose
painting class I took as a grad student at Harvard.  Julian knew
about business, but you would not describe him as a suit.  Among
other things he'd been president of the National Lampoon .  He was
also a lawyer, and got all our paperwork set up properly.  In return
for $10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us what
business was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Julian
got 10% of Viaweb.  I remember thinking once what a good deal
Julian got

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Among other things he'd been'?
Answer:","Among
other things he'd been president of the National Lampoon"
"Context:  For the price of a Linux box, a
copy of K&R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor's fifteen
year old son, you'll be well on your way. [4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest
company of all, the government.  Yes, there are lots of opportunities
to sell them technology.  But let someone else start those startups. [5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care 
about the paperwork there, and that there's more of it.  Which helps
explain why there are not more startups in Germany. [6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because
Julian got 10% of the company

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Yes, there are lots of'?
Answer:","Yes, there are lots of opportunities
to sell them technology"
"Context:  But I think there's more going on than this.  There
are real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds of
work they can outweigh the advantages. Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided
to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel.
First there'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose.
Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one
side or the other

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Imagine, for example, what would'?
Answer:","Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided
to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel"
"Context: One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan your
startup while you're getting those n years of experience.  Sure,
go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever, but get
together regularly to scheme, so the idea of starting a startup
stays alive in everyone's brain.  I don't know if this works, but
it can't hurt to try. It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have as
students.  Some of your classmates are probably going to be successful
startup founders; at a great technical university, that is a near
certainty.  So which ones?  If I were you I'd look for the people
who are not just smart, but incurable builders 

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'So which ones? If I'?
Answer:","So which ones?  If I were you I'd look for the people
who are not just smart, but incurable builders"
"Context:  If a salesman wants to work harder,
he can just start doing it, and he will automatically
get paid proportionally more. There is one other job besides sales where big companies can
hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. 
And for the same reason: their performance can
be measured.  The top managers are
held responsible for the performance of the entire company.
Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually
be measured, he is not expected to do
more than put in a solid effort.  Whereas top management, like
salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.
The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in  
a solid effort

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If a salesman wants to'?
Answer:","If a salesman wants to work harder,
he can just start doing it, and he will automatically
get paid proportionally more"
"Context: September 2009 Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to
predict which startups will succeed.  We probably spend more time
thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.
Prediction is usually all we have to rely on. We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is
determination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.
Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed.  It
makes a better story that a company won because its founders were
so smart.  The PR people and reporters who spread such stories
probably believe them themselves.  But while it certainly helps to
be smart, it's not the deciding factor

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Everyone likes to believe that's'?
Answer:",Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed
"Context:  When people came to YC to speak
at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone
coming to address a Boy Scout troop.  By the time they left the
building they were all saying some variant of ""Wow, these
companies might actually succeed."" Now YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprised
when the companies we fund are legit, but it took a
while for reputation to catch up with reality.  That's one of the
reasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissed
as ""toys""  because YC itself was dismissed as one initially. When we saw how well it worked to fund companies synchronously,
we decided we'd keep doing that.  We'd fund two batches of
startups a year

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'When people came to YC'?
Answer:","When people came to YC to speak
at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone

"Context:  If you look at the average
outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors
like them, and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational
choice for founders to start them. Deals Why do investors like startups so much?  Why are they so hot to
invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making
businesses?  Not only for the obvious reason. The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.  Startups
pass that test because although they're appallingly risky, the
returns when they do succeed are so high.  But that's not the only
reason investors like startups.  An ordinary slower-growing business
might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were
lower

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'The test of any investment'?
Answer:",The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk
"Context: If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these
especially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do they
need to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you
get them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the
question, how do you become one? More than Money I know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about
what they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably that
they really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay
the bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,
and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'What motivates them? What do'?
Answer:","What motivates them?  What do they
need to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you
get them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the

"Context: [ 7 ] And though there's going to be one investor who gives them the first
check, and his or her help in recruiting other investors will
certainly be welcome, this initial investor will no longer be the
lead in the old sense of managing the round.  The startup will now
do that themselves. There will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investors
who take the lead in advising a startup.  They may also make
the biggest investment.  But they won't always have to be the one
terms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they have
in the past.  Standardized paperwork will do away with the need to
negotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easier
too

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Standardized paperwork will do away'?
Answer:","Standardized paperwork will do away with the need to
negotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easier
too"
"Context:  Standards are
higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind
of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries
are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the
same business.  Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost
startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's
clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each. 3. Marginal Niche Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common
problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding
competition. If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a
certain age they're afraid of the ball

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Standards are higher; people are'?
Answer:","Standards are
higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind
of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries
are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the
same business"
"Context:  Whereas if you're talking to an angel who
invests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you
probably want to focus on your least expensive plan. If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit
on what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the
number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In
most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number
of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost
(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k per
month is high, so don't actually spend that much.  But it's ok to
use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'But it's ok to use'?
Answer:","But it's ok to
use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error"
"Context:  They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable.
They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to?  (VCs
are like high school girls: they're acutely aware of their position
in the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a
function of the interest other VCs show in it.) One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders
a term sheet.  A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms
will be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the details
later.  By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn
away other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the
""due diligence"" required for the deal

Answer:",") One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders
a term sheet"
"Context:  In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries
online.  But galleries didn't want to be online.  It's not how the
art business works.  So why did I spend 6 months working on this
stupid idea?  Because I didn't pay attention to users.  I invented
a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked
from that.  I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried
to convince users to pay for what we'd built.  Even then I took
embarrassingly long to catch on.  I was attached to my model of the
world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software.  They had to
want it! Why do so many founders build things no one wants?  Because they
begin by trying to think of startup ideas.  That m.o

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'It's not how the art'?
Answer:","It's not how the
art business works"
"Context: Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup
experience themselves: VC investors don't know half the time what they are talking
    about and are years behind in their thinking.  A few were great,
    but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional,
    didn't seem to be very good at business or have any kind of
    creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to. Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless?  I think it's
because they seem so formidable. The reason VCs seem formidable is that it's their profession to.
You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with
hundreds of millions of dollars

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Angels are a bit better'?
Answer:","Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup
experience themselves: VC investors don't know half the time what they are talking
    about and are years behind in their thinking"
"Context:  Do they want me to do something beyond just
reading some text?  How important is it?  (There obviously has to
be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is
important.)  When does it have to be done? This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting
an immovable object.  On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible
to replace

"Context:  Programmers learn by doing,
and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't—sometimes
because the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's
code wouldn't let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead
of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions
imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a
fraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has
learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has
to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at
least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants. An obstacle downstream propagates upstream

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'He said he has learned'?
Answer:","He said he has
learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has

"Context: So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the
Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction.
Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems
they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might
solve them. [ 2 ] What do people complain about?  What do you wish there was? 5. Obstinacy In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you
want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you
encounter.  Starting startups is not one of them.  The stick-to-your-vision
approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,
where the problem is well-defined

"Context:  If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop
apps for that instead. How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?
It's unlikely you could make something better designed.  Apple
leaves no room there.  So this alternative device probably couldn't
win on general appeal.  It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically. One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'How could you make a'?
Answer:","How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?
It's unlikely you could make something better designed"
"Context: What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing
cofounders was character and commitment, not ability.  This was
particularly true with startups that failed.  The lesson: don't
pick cofounders who will flake. Here's a typical reponse: You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked
    with them on a startup. The reason character is so important is that it's tested more
severely than in most other situations.  One founder said explicitly
that the relationship between founders was more important than
ability: I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger
    with higher output

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'One founder said explicitly that'?
Answer:","One founder said explicitly
that the relationship between founders was more important than
ability: I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger
    with higher output"
"Context:  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.
Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and
McCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation
programs even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960. It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.
That will tend to drive your language to have new features that   
programmers need.  I personally am interested in writing
a language that will be good for writing server-based applications

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'That will tend to drive'?
Answer:","That will tend to drive your language to have new features that   
programmers need"
"Context: The other big change is that now, you're steering.  You can go
anywhere you want. So it may be worth standing back and understanding
what's going on, instead of just doing the default thing. All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads 
have been thinking about what employers want.  But what really 
matters is what customers want, because they're the ones who give
employers the money to pay you. So instead of thinking about what employers want, you're probably
better off thinking directly about what users want.  To the extent 
there's any difference between the two, you can even use that to
your advantage if you start a company of your own

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'So instead of thinking about'?
Answer:","So instead of thinking about what employers want, you're probably
better off thinking directly about what users want"
"Context:  But even then we barely made
it.  The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders
not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.

We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken
when we started Viaweb.  We started Viaweb with $10k we got from

"Context:  The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to
decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.  If
there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both
equally committed to the business, that's easy.  But if you have a
number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees,
arranging the proportions of stock can be hard.  And once you've
done it, it tends to be set in stone. I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.  All I can say is,
try hard to do it right.  I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing
when you have, though

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'All I can say is,'?
Answer:","All I can say is,

"Context: It's just a legitimate
sounding way of saying: we don't like your type around here. But the best thing of all is when people call what you're doing
inappropriate.  I've been hearing this word all my life and I only
recently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homing
beacon.  ""Inappropriate"" is the null criticism.  It's merely the
adjective form of ""I don't like it."" So that, I think, should be the highest goal for the marginal.  Be
inappropriate.  When you hear people saying that, you're golden.
And they, incidentally, are busted. Notes [ 1 ]

"Context:  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves
so they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers
don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They
work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere
to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass
boxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take
a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at
their desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with
vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime
hacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate

"Context:  But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was the
people they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google and
Apple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.
And it's largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today. Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?  Partly
because they can afford to be.  The best programmers can work
wherever they want.  They don't have to work for a company they
have qualms about. But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity

"Context:  As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying
""I'm just a kid"" that will get you out of most difficult situations.
Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.  They still
do, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned. The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge.
Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge
from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.  If an
adult says ""that's a stupid idea,"" a kid will either crawl away
with his tail between his legs, or rebel.  But rebelling presumes
inferiority as much as submission

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If an adult says ""that's'?
Answer:","If an
adult says ""that's a stupid idea,"" a kid will either crawl away
with his tail between his legs, or rebel"
"Context: The reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price is
that valuation caps aren't actual valuations, and notes are cheap
and easy to do.  So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if you
wanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for each
investor. That cap need not simply rise monotonically.  A startup could 
also give better deals to investors they expected to help
them most.  The point is simply that different investors, 
whether because of the help they offer or their willingness to
commit, have different values for
startups, and their terms should reflect that. Different terms for different investors is
clearly the way of the future

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A startup could also give'?
Answer:","A startup could 
also give better deals to investors they expected to help

"Context:  My only leisure activities were
running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about
fifteen minutes of reading a night.  I had a girlfriend for a total
of two months during that three year period.  Every couple weeks I
would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a  
friend's house for dinner.  I went to visit my family twice.
Otherwise I just worked. Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some
of my best friends.  Sometimes it was even technically interesting.
But only about 10% of the time

fifteen minutes of reading a night"
"Context: Cook another 2 or
3 minutes, then add beans (don't drain the beans), and stir. Throw
in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least
10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking. If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount
stores.  Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk.
If there's an Indian grocery store near you, they'll have big 
bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets. [ 2 ]
There's a good chance that a shift in power from investors

"Context:  On the web, articles
you have to pay for might as well not exist.  Even if you were    
willing to pay to read them yourself, you can't link to them.    
They're not part of the conversation. Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as
news.  I never look at any news site now except Reddit . [ 2 ] I know if something major
happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it   
will show up there.  Why bother checking the front page of any
specific paper or magazine?  Reddit's like an RSS feed for the whole

"Context:  Once you've  
acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can
take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to 
start with raw Lisp. Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read. An instance of this type
of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator;
an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand
a special-purpose subroutine. [1] Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns
in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about
the design of your program

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Once you've acquired a large'?
Answer:","Once you've  
acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can
take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to 
start with raw Lisp"
"Context:  They've invested in dozens of startups,
whereas this is probably the first you've founded.  But don't let
them or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarter
than the average VC.  So just do what you'd do in any complex,
unfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anything
that seems odd. It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreement
whose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCs
to defend things they do by saying that they're standard in the
industry.  Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a few
decades old, and rapidly evolving

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'But don't let them or'?
Answer:","But don't let
them or the situation intimidate you"
"Context:  If you want to make your
user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every
day plot the number of users.  You'll be delighted when it goes up
and disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you'll start
noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more
of that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure. 8. Spend little. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.
Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the
most common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheap
is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly. [ 4 ] But it's
more than that

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If you want to make'?
Answer:","If you want to make your
user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every
day plot the number of users"
"Context:  Markets always evolve toward higher
resolution.  You may not need to use convertible notes to do it.
With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and some
changes in investors' and lawyers' expectations about equity rounds)
you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt.
Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can easily
change their valuation. Deadlocks weren't the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.
Another was that startups had to decide in advance how much to
raise.  I think it's a mistake for a startup to fix upon a specific
number

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity'?
Answer:","With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and some
changes in investors' and lawyers' expectations about equity rounds)
you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt"
"Context:  We
didn't know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones.  We
thought software was all that mattered.  But that turned out to be
the right direction to be naive in: it's much better to overestimate
than underestimate the importance of making a good product. [ 6 ]
I've omitted one source: government grants

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'But that turned out to'?
Answer:","But that turned out to be
the right direction to be naive in: it's much better to overestimate
than underestimate the importance of making a good product"
"Context:  The professors will get whoever they
admit as their own grad students, so they try hard to choose well,
and they have a fair amount of data to go on.  Whereas undergraduate
admissions seem to be much more hackable. One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the
overlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teach
the subject in universities.  At one end of the scale you have
fields like math and physics, where nearly all the teachers are
among the best practitioners.  In the middle are medicine, law,
history, architecture, and computer science, where many are

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'In the middle are medicine,'?
Answer:","In the middle are medicine, law,
history, architecture, and computer science, where many are"
"Context:  The people are the most important ingredient
in a startup, so don't compromise there. 18. A Half-Hearted Effort The failed startups you hear most about are the spectacular
flameouts.  Those are actually the elite of failures.  The most
common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the
one that doesn't do much of anything — the one we never even hear
about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the
side while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere
and was gradually abandoned. Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the
most important thing is to quit your day job

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Those are actually the elite'?
Answer:",Those are actually the elite of failures
"Context: But if VCs ask, just point out that they
wouldn't want you telling other firms about your conversations, and
you feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to.  If they
push you, point out that you're inexperienced at fundraising — which
is always a safe card to play — and you feel you have to be
extra cautious. [ 3 ] While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almost
all will at least initially experience the other side of this
phenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance.
The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors'
opinions means you always start out in something of a hole

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'The fact that investors are'?
Answer:","The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors'
opinions means you always start out in something of a hole"
"Context:  Humans
also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about
hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own
experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8
work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50
is really unwieldy. [ 1 ] Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in
groups of several hundred.  And yet—for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature—a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees. Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide
themselves into units small enough to work together

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'And yet—for reasons having more'?
Answer:","And yet—for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature—a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees"
"Context:  At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where
a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant
building as a ""high-tech incubator,"" as if it were merely lack of
the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town
from becoming a startup hub .  
At the other extreme are places like
Idealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires
people to work for them. The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead,
were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the
startups they funded.  In addition to working in their space, you
were supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and
so on

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'At one extreme is the'?
Answer:","At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where
a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant
building as a ""high-tech incubator,"" as if it were merely lack of
the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town

"Context:  If the company does badly, he's done badly. A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly   
would be enormously successful.  Many employees would work harder
if they could get paid for it.  More importantly,
such a company would attract people who wanted to work
especially hard. 
It would crush its competitors. Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen.  Salesmen
work alone.  Most employees' work is tangled together.  Suppose
a company makes some kind of consumer gadget

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'More importantly, such a company'?
Answer:","More importantly,
such a company would attract people who wanted to work
especially hard"
"Context:   All the super-angels know
is that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,
and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry
about. Rounds Whatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is
good news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason that
more competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape of
deals is changing. One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount
of your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A round
they want a third of your company, if they can get it

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'And not just for the'?
Answer:","And not just for the obvious reason that
more competition for deals means better terms"
"Context:  One of the reasons was that, to save
money, he'd designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP
felt they couldn't produce anything so declasse. Less Wozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn't
afford a monitor.  Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to
make things that are cheap and lightweight.  And both are good bets
for growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things
evolve faster. The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large
scale

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Outsiders are not merely free'?
Answer:","Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to
make things that are cheap and lightweight"
"Context:  Before you launch, you're like a
police artist before he's shown the first version of his sketch to
the witness. It's so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of
your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting
users to start talking to you. I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a
    giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments,
    and those that have a market show promising results extremely
    quickly. Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you'll be surprised
by what they tell you

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Before you launch, you're like'?
Answer:","Before you launch, you're like a
police artist before he's shown the first version of his sketch to
the witness"
"Context:  You're flying on instruments, in effect, so you should
(a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on
your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the
instruments. In this case the instruments are the users.  When designing for
other people you have to be empirical.  You can no longer guess
what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses.
So if you're going to make something for teenagers or ""business""
users or some other group that doesn't include you, you have to be
able to talk some specific ones into using what you're making.  If
you can't, you're on the wrong track. 11. Raising Too Little Money Most successful startups take funding at some point

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If you can't, you're on'?
Answer:","If
you can't, you're on the wrong track"
"Context: What hackers like to do is make great programs.
And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's
an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work 
doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual
currency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as
worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a
horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper
about. 1. How to Organize Big Libraries? Libraries are becoming an
increasingly important component of programming languages.  They're
also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Intellectually, it is just as'?
Answer:","Intellectually, it is just as
worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a
horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper
about"
"Context:  An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  And it's
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren't the ones that win.  I think the reason Google embraced ""Don't
be evil"" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance. [ 1 ] That has worked for Google so far.  They've become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles. With Apple that seems less the case.  When you
look at the famous 1984 ad now, it's easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'An organization that wins by'?
Answer:","An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work"
"Context:  It's conventionally
fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages.
You're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold,
whatever your age. How do you tell?  There are a couple tests adults use.  I realized
these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.  I noticed
that I felt like I was talking to someone much older.  Afterward I
wondered, what am I even measuring?  What made him seem older? One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.
When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you
can cry and say ""I can't do it"" and the adults will probably let
you off

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'When you're a little kid'?
Answer:","When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you
can cry and say ""I can't do it"" and the adults will probably let
you off"
"Context: We've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested
their first priority should be to find a cofounder.  Both did.  But
we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied.
It's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just
been funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to
sign up for something super hard. If you don't have a cofounder, what should you do?  Get one.  It's
more important than anything else.  If there's no one where you
live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are
people who do.  If no one wants to work with you on your current
idea, switch to an idea people want to work on

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If there's no one where'?
Answer:","If there's no one where you
live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are
people who do"
"Context:  Plus series A
terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of
important decisions, including selling the company.  Founders usually
have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things
are going well.  But that's not the same as just being able to do
what you want, like you could before. A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that
they're less stressful to raise.  Raising a traditional series A
round has in the past taken weeks, if not months.  When a VC firm
can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about
which they do

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A third and quite significant'?
Answer:","A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that
they're less stressful to raise"
"Context:  First, this mail
probably wouldn't get through the filters of someone who didn't
happen to specialize in programming languages and have a good
friend called Morris.  For the average user, all the top five words here 
would be neutral and would not contribute to the spam probability. Second, I think filtering based on word pairs 
(see below) might well
catch this one:  ""cost effective"", ""setup fee"", ""money back"" -- pretty
incriminating stuff.  And of course if they continued to spam me
(or a network I was part of), ""Hostex"" itself would be
recognized as  a spam term

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'And of course if they'?
Answer:","And of course if they continued to spam me
(or a network I was part of), ""Hostex"" itself would be
recognized as  a spam term"
"Context:  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the
variation we see is something that more and more fields will see
as time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, will
depend increasingly on how they deal with it. If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the
contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be
disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  When
you reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1%
of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,
or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If variation in productivity increases'?
Answer:","If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the
contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be
disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time"
"Context:  If anyone
wants to take on this project, it would be a good thing for
the world. Appendix: Defining Spam I think there is a rough
consensus on what spam is, but it would be useful to have
an explicit definition.  We'll need to do this if we want to establish
a central corpus of spam, or even to compare spam filtering
rates meaningfully. To start with, spam is not unsolicited commercial email.
If someone in my neighborhood heard that I was looking for an old
Raleigh three-speed in good condition, and sent me an email
offering to sell me one, I'd be delighted, and yet this
email would be both commercial and unsolicited

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Appendix: Defining Spam I think'?
Answer:","Appendix: Defining Spam I think there is a rough
consensus on what spam is, but it would be useful to have

"Context:  They also tend to cause you to grow out     
of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office
building that will make your software worse.  But worst of all,
they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone's    
office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to
have a meeting about it.  So the fewer people you can hire, the
better. During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.  They
wanted to get ""staffed up"" as soon as possible, as if you couldn't 
get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding 
job title.  That's big company thinking.  Don't hire people to fill
the gaps in some a priori org chart

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'During the Bubble a lot'?
Answer:",During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy
"Context: Most smart
high school kids at least consider going into the sciences, even
if they ultimately choose not to.
Why go to a college that limits their options? Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Alex Lewin, Jessica Livingston,
Robert Morris, Eric
Raymond, and several anonymous CS professors for reading drafts of this, and to the students whose questions
began it.

"Context: A New Search Engine The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible.  I don't
know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be.
Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently
I've noticed some cracks in their fortress. The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their
way was when they decided to get into the search business.  That
was not a natural move for Microsoft.  They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business.  But
this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b)
Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't good at. Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'They did it because they'?
Answer:","They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business"
"Context:  Indeed, although investors hate it,
you are for this reason justified in raising your valuation for
later investors.  The investors who invested when you had no money
were taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns.  Plus a
company that has raised money is literally more valuable.  After
you raise the first million dollars, the company is at least a
million dollars more valuable, because it's the same company as
before, plus it has a million dollars in the bank

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Plus a company that has'?
Answer:","Plus a
company that has raised money is literally more valuable"
"Context:  So they tend to
come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come
with tougher terms. The word ""venture capitalist"" is sometimes used loosely for any
venture investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs and
other investors: VC firms are organized as funds , much like
hedge funds or mutual funds.  The fund managers, who are called
""general partners,"" get about 2% of the fund annually as a management
fee, plus about 20% of the fund's gains

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'So they tend to come'?
Answer:","So they tend to
come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come
with tougher terms"
"Context:  That means the wind of procrastination will be
in your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what you
do as a way of avoiding other work.  And when you do it, you'll be
in a better mood.  The more the work depends on imagination, the
more that matters, because most people have more ideas when they're
happy. If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing
I'd do more of: just try hacking things together.  Like many people
that age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do.
I also spent some time trying to build stuff.  I should have spent
less time worrying and more time building.  If you're not sure what
to do, make something

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'I should have spent less'?
Answer:","I should have spent
less time worrying and more time building"
"Context:  I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk
to them you realize that it's a seller's market.  Even now there
is too much money chasing too few good deals. VCs form a pyramid.  At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and
Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you've never 
heard of.  What they all have in common is that a dollar from them 
is worth one dollar.  Most VCs will tell you that they don't just 
provide money, but connections and advice.  If you're talking to  
Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.  But such
advice and connections can come very expensive.  And as you go down
the food chain the VCs get rapidly dumber

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Even now there is too'?
Answer:","Even now there
is too much money chasing too few good deals"
"Context: [ 6 ] Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound
on user experience, it's interesting in a very pleasant way to think
about how far you could go to delight your users. Experience I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention
to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:
insanely great.  Steve wasn't just using ""insanely"" as a synonym
for ""very.""  He meant it more literally — that one should focus
on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be
considered pathological. All the most successful startups we've funded have, and that probably
doesn't surprise would-be founders

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about '"" He meant it more'?
Answer:","""  He meant it more literally — that one should focus
on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be
considered pathological"
"Context:  If investors are impressed
with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it's a
rich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the
slow sales cycle. They're not necessarily trying to mislead you.  Most investors are
genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike
startups.  If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more.
But don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you
have it too; almost everyone does. There is a role for ideas of course.  They're fuel for the fire
that starts with liking the founders

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'But don't be too smug'?
Answer:","But don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you
have it too; almost everyone does"
"Context:  Whereas founders' intuitions about
which hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.
Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones. The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can
actually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growth
as a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with some
initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%
weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than
you meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% a
week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Most fairly good ideas are'?
Answer:",Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones
"Context:  Most hackers' first instinct is
to try to write software that recognizes individual properties of
spam.  You look at spams
and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail 
that begins ""Dear Friend"" or has a subject line that's all
uppercase and ends in eight exclamation points.  I can filter
out that stuff with about one line of code. And so you do,
and in the beginning it works.  A few simple rules will take
a big bite out of your incoming spam.  Merely looking
for the word ""click"" will catch 79.7% of the
emails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives. I spent about six months writing software that looked for
individual spam features before I tried the statistical
approach

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'You look at spams and'?
Answer:","You look at spams
and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail 
that begins ""Dear Friend"" or has a subject line that's all

"Context:  Do I really want
to support this company? * * * Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users? There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.  If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Do I really want to'?
Answer:","Do I really want
to support this company? * * * Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users? There are a couple reasons they should care"
"Context:  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some
new things. One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based 
apps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a
year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a
series of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten
releases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest
version. You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?
Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be
changeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least
to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Instead of having one or'?
Answer:","Instead of having one or two big releases a
year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a
series of small changes"
"Context: We were going to do
seed funding with standardized terms.  Before YC, seed funding was
very haphazard. You'd get that first $10k from your friend's rich
uncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the
investor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents
should look like.  Facebook's early history as a Florida LLC shows
how random things could be in those days.  We were going to be
something there had not been before: a standard source of seed
funding. We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken
when we started Viaweb

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'We were going to be'?
Answer:","We were going to be
something there had not been before: a standard source of seed
funding"
"Context: So, who's right?  James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss?
Not surprisingly, Gosling is right.  Some languages are better,
for certain problems, than others.  And you know, that raises some
interesting questions.  Java was designed to be better, for certain
problems, than C++.  What problems?  When is Java better and 
when is C++?  Are there situations where other languages are
better than either of them? Once you start considering this question, you have opened a
real can of worms.  If the pointy-haired boss had to think
about the problem in its full complexity, it would make his
brain explode

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'And you know, that raises'?
Answer:","And you know, that raises some
interesting questions"
"Context:  In my earlier spam-filtering software, the user
could set up a list of such words and mail containing
them would automatically get past the filters.  On my
list I put words like ""Lisp"" and also my zipcode, so
that (otherwise rather spammy-sounding) receipts from
online orders would get through.  I thought I was being
very clever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did the
same thing for me, and moreover discovered of a lot of words I
hadn't thought of. When I said at the start that our filters let through less than
5 spams per 1000 with 0 false positives, I'm talking about
filtering my mail based on a corpus of my mail

Answer:","I thought I was being
very clever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did the
same thing for me, and moreover discovered of a lot of words I

"Context:  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on
it.  He didn't think he was starting a company.  If these guys had
thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted
to do something more ""serious,"" and that would have been a mistake. So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage
you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.
Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems
like the problem is important enough to build a company on.  If you
keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making
something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,
you've got a company

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'So if you want to'?
Answer:","So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage
you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part"
"Context: It seems that, for the average engineer, more options just means
more rope to hang yourself.  So if you want to start a startup, you
can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, 
and assume you could build something way easier to use. Design for Exit Success for a startup approximately equals getting bought.  You
need some kind of exit strategy, because you can't get the smartest
people to work for you without giving them options likely to be
worth something.  Which means you either have to get bought or go
public, and the number of startups that go public is very small

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Which means you either have'?
Answer:","Which means you either have to get bought or go
public, and the number of startups that go public is very small"
"Context: I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'When I walked into the'?
Answer:","When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam"
"Context:  If you're
controlling them, they're not drifting.  But you can control them
indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get
into.  That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
become critical to you.  Try to get yourself into situations where
the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about. You don't have complete control, of course.  An emergency could
push other thoughts out of your head.  But barring emergencies you
have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea
in your mind. I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth
avoiding  thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push
out more interesting ideas

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'That has been the lesson'?
Answer:","That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
become critical to you"
"Context:  A really good hacker can squeeze more
out of better tools. As one data point on the curve, at any rate,
if you were to compete with ITA and
chose to write your software in C, they would be able to develop
software twenty times faster than you.
If you spent a year on a new feature, they'd be able to
duplicate it in less than three weeks.  Whereas if they spent
just three months developing something new, it would be five years before you had it too

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Whereas if they spent just'?
Answer:","Whereas if they spent
just three months developing something new, it would be five years before you had it too"
"Context:  Growth is why startups usually
work on technology — because ideas for fast growing companies are
so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those
recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source
of rapid change.  Growth is why it's a rational choice economically
for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the
successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high
even though the risk is too.  Growth is why VCs want to invest in
startups: not just because the returns are high but also because
generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than
generating returns from dividends

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Growth is why it's a'?
Answer:","Growth is why it's a rational choice economically
for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the
successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high
even though the risk is too"
"Context:  Suppose you approached investors with the following
idea for a Web 2.0 startup: Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to ""tag"" content
  with descriptive tokens.  But there is also huge source of implicit tags that they ignore: the text within web links.
  Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the   
  individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using
  graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the
  reputation of each member.  We plan to mine the web for these 
  implicit tags, and use them together with the reputation hierarchy
  they embody to enhance web searches

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'us and flickr allow users'?
Answer:","us and flickr allow users to ""tag"" content
  with descriptive tokens"
"Context:   It's not something like physics or medicine
that requires extensive study.  You just try to get people to pay
you for stuff. I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was
disgusted by the idea of doing it.  I wanted to work in the pure,   
intellectual world of software, not deal with customers' mundane  
problems.  People who don't want to get dragged into some kind of
work often develop a protective incompetence at it.  Paul Erdos was
particularly good at this.  By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit
in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other
people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for
math

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'It's not something like physics'?
Answer:","It's not something like physics or medicine
that requires extensive study"
"Context:  So
don't be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment,
because much of the difficulty comes from this external force.  The
second will be easier. Notes [ 1 ]
An accountant might say that a company that has raised a million
dollars is no richer if it's convertible debt, but in practice money
raised as convertible debt is little different from money raised
in an equity round. [ 2 ]
Founders are often surprised by this, but investors can get
very emotional.  Or rather indignant; that's the main emotion I've
observed; but it is very common, to the point where it sometimes
causes investors to act against their own interests

There is one subtle danger you have to watch out for here, which
I warn about later: beware of getting too high a valuation from an

If they really need a meeting, then they're not ready to invest,

Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups.  Naive
founders think ""Wow, a VC is interested in us!""  But an associate
is not a VC.  They have no decision-making power

Answer:","[ 5 ]
Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups"
"Context:  All users
care about is whether your site or software gives them what they
want.  They don't care if the person behind it is a high school 
kid. If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate
for you?  Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big
company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get
you? When most people hear the word ""startup,"" they think of the famous 
ones that have gone public.  But most startups that succeed do it
by getting bought.  And usually the acquirer doesn't just want the
technology, but the people who created it as well. Often big companies buy startups before they're profitable.  Obviously
in such cases they're not after revenues

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'But most startups that succeed'?
Answer:","But most startups that succeed do it
by getting bought"
"Context:  But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition
was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. [ 11 ] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries
that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet
Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor
governments of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Take away the incentive
of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt. Remember what a startup is, economically: 
a way of saying, I want to work faster.  Instead of accumulating
money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I 
want to get it over with as soon as possible

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Take away the incentive of'?
Answer:","Take away the incentive
of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt"
"Context:  I think
this will become more common; the average founder is eager to do
it, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock will
not, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed to
the business. The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and so
on balance I'm grateful rather than angry.  (As in families, relations
between founders and investors can be complicated.) The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions.
You could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, like
VCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they
respect. Deal terms with angels vary a lot.  There are no generally accepted
standards

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Deal terms with angels vary'?
Answer:",Deal terms with angels vary a lot
"Context: If you do have to
leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long.  If
a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can 
return to academic life.  And if it succeeds, you may find you no   
longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor. If you want to do it, do it.  Starting a startup is not the great
mystery it seems from outside.  It's not something you have to know
about ""business"" to do.  Build something users love, and spend less
than you make.  How hard is that? Notes [1] Google's revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes
from ads on other sites

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If you do have to'?
Answer:","If you do have to
leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long"
"Context:  You know from
an early age that you'll have some sort of job, because everyone
asks what you're going to ""be"" when you grow up. What they
don't tell you is that as a kid you're sitting on the shoulders of
someone else who's treading water, and that starting working means
you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading
water yourself or sink.  ""Being"" something is incidental; the
immediate problem is not to drown. The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only
gradually.  At least it did for me.  One's first thought tends to
be simply ""This sucks.  I'm in debt

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'You know from an early'?
Answer:","You know from
an early age that you'll have some sort of job, because everyone
asks what you're going to ""be"" when you grow up"
"Context:  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing
from you, you won't die. That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You've probably noticed
that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders
causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every
dinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.
So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will
push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed
to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time
we talked. If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be pretty
cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get
rich

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'If this works, it would'?
Answer:","If this works, it would be an amazing hack"
"Context: And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans
depending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able
to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability
without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred
thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a
couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc. Different plans match different investors.  If you're talking to a
VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of
those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your
most expensive plan

"Context: August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010 In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far. Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the average
startup fails.  When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work.  Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'The average startup probably doesn't'?
Answer:","The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks"
"Context:  What a bang that balloon is going
to make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative 
to MS Office. [ 5 ] Who will?  Google?  They seem to be taking their
time.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old
hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  (How hard
can it be?) The Common Thread Ajax, democracy, and not dissing users.  What do they all have in  
common?  I didn't realize they had anything in common till recently,
which is one of the reasons I disliked the term ""Web 2.0"" so much.
It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened
to be new—that it didn't predict anything. But there is a common thread

hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea"
"Context:  But
there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups. By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.
Investors were excited about the Internet.  One reason they were
excited was Yahoo's revenue growth.  So they invested in new Internet
startups.  The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to
get traffic.  Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and
further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.
When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up
like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of ""Eureka!"" I was
shouting ""Sell!"" Both the Internet startups and the Procter & Gambles were doing

"Context:  Being lead
developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much. That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.  What
about in the general case?  Because in another sense, it is a problem
if you don't have an idea.  If you start a startup with no idea,
what do you do next? So here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.  Find something
that's missing in your own life, and supply that need—no matter
how specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer;
who knew so many other people would want them?  A need that's narrow
but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but
hypothetical

"Context:  You're doing the same thing, setting up
a separate place to hold the accumulator; it's just
a field in an object instead of the head of a list.
And the use of these special,
reserved field names, especially __call__ , seems
a bit of a hack. In the rivalry between Perl and Python, the claim of the
Python hackers seems to be that
that Python is a more elegant alternative to Perl, but what
this case shows is that power is the ultimate elegance:
the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if the
syntax is a bit uglier

"Context:  Sometimes angels' deal terms are as fearsome as VCs'.
Other angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest based
on a two-page agreement. Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what
terms they want.  They just want to invest in this startup.  What
kind of anti-dilution protection do they want?  Hell if they know.
In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel
asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms end
up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.  Which in practice
usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around
his firm

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Which in practice usually means,'?
Answer:","Which in practice
usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around

"Context: Startups Take Over Your Life Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than
it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the
founders and the company.  Running a startup is not like having a
job or being a student, because it never stops.  This is so foreign
to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens. [ 1 ] I didn't realize I would spend almost every waking moment either
    working or thinking about our startup.  You enter a whole
    different way of life when it's your company vs. working for
    someone else's company

"Context:  Now that you
can use any language, you have to think about which one to use.
Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that
their competitors do not. If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.
For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be
important in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, so
a company that could get new features done before its competitors
would have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good language
for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify
the effect of rapid development, because you can release software
the minute it's done

Answer:","Now that you

"Context:  One reason the young sometimes
succeed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent
they are.  This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.  When they
first start working on something, they overrate their achievements.
But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance
improves.  Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial
incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from
continuing. There's one other major component of determination: ambition.  If
willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,
ambition is how you choose it

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'This lets them do a'?
Answer:",This lets them do a kind of deficit spending
"Context:  Many are annoyed that these
so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them
will amount to anything. If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be
less indignant.  The mistake they're making is that by basing their
opinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the
median rather than the average.  If you judge by the median startup,
the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.  You have to
invent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or
investors want to fund them.  But it's a mistake to use the median
in a domain with so much variation

Answer:","Many are annoyed that these
so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them
will amount to anything"
"Context:  Even if you start the way most successful startups
have, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you
build is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penalties
for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection
initially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to get
something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,
and then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excuse
for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users
is always inaccurate, even if you're one of them. [ 7 ] The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users

"Context:  I think people believe that coming
up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it must be
very hard-- and so they don't try do to it.  They assume ideas are
like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don't. I also have a theory about why people think this.  They overvalue
ideas.  They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementing
some fabulous initial idea.  And since a successful startup is worth
millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea. If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a
million dollar idea, then of course it's going to seem hard.  Too
hard to bother trying

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'And since a successful startup'?
Answer:","And since a successful startup is worth
millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea"
"Context:  The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks
in every joint.  In the future this mess will gradually be replaced
by a single, huge pipe.  The water will still have to get from A
to B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying
out through some random leak. This will change a lot of things for the better.  In a big, straight
pipe like that, the force of being measured by one's performance
will propagate back through the whole system.  Performance is always
the ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now
that most people are insulated from it most of the time

"Context: May 2004 (This essay was originally published in Hackers 
& Painters .) If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup.  That's been a 
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word ""startup"" 
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is 
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages. Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
""high-tech startup"" is almost redundant.  A startup is a small
company that takes on a hard technical problem. Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that.

"Context: This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting
at Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short
that they rarely include much if any demo.  They seem to work
just as well without, however, which makes me think I was
wrong to emphasize demos so much before. A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal
description.  The only thing worth talking about first is the problem
you're trying to solve and why it's important.  But don't spend
more than a tenth of your time on that.  Then demo. When you demo, don't run through a catalog of features.  Instead
start with the problem you're solving, and then show how your product
solves it

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'A demo explains what you've'?
Answer:","A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal
description"
"Context:  If you're not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.
So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful. Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of
course.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big
company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing
the startup. You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size
of company you work for.  If you start the company, you'll have the
most freedom

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'You can adjust the amount'?
Answer:","You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size
of company you work for"
"Context:  That was our favorite part of the Bay Area.
But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley.  We didn't
have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get
enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over
part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View.
Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the
ideal place to put something like YC.  But even then we barely made
it.  The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders
not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.

Initially we only had part of the idea. We were going to do
seed funding with standardized terms.  Before YC, seed funding was
very haphazard

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Initially we only had part'?
Answer:",Initially we only had part of the idea
"Context: April 2010 The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the
question: what do you wish someone would make for you? There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically
out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you.  Apple
was the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer.  Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design
one, so he did.  And since lots of other people wanted the same
thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company
rolling.  They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.
The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'Apple happened because Steve Wozniak'?
Answer:","Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a

"Context:  How could any technology that old even be
relevant, let alone superior to the latest developments? I'll tell you how.  It's because Lisp was not really
designed to be a programming language, at least not in the sense
we mean today.  What we mean by a programming language is
something we use to tell a computer what to do

Question: In the following Paul Graham passage, what does he say about 'It's because Lisp was not'?
