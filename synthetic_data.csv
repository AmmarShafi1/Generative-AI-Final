"Context: The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even
realize at first that they're startup ideas. This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies

"Context:  About 20% of the
startups we've funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so often
that we've reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don't require
it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly
way for people to quit. A founder leaving doesn't necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plenty
of successful startups have had that happen. [ 11 ] Fortunately it's
usually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are three
founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you have

"Context:  For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever
had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.
Thousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world's infrastructure?  Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea
of fixing payments. Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking ""should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?"" and chose the recipe site

Language and program evolve together.

then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they

startups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious.
But if angel investors become more active and better known, they'll

Here's the excerpt:

[ 6 ] Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turned
down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations
were too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.
But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble
about valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returns"
"Context:   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.
Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their
head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just
that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee
wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due
partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  ""Perfect'' eyesight
means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley
had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.
Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by
using a very dense language, 
which shrinks the court.) This could explain the disconnect over cubicles

you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley

the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.
But more importantly, by selecting that small a group
you can get the best rowers.  Each one will be in

Q: What is the key advantage of using a ten-man boat show over a large boat show?
A: The key advantage of using a ten-man boat show is that it allows for the selection of the best rowers, leading to a better deal for them.

Q: How does the small group of rowers in the ten-man boat show contribute to the overall success of the startup?

solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems

"Context: March 2007 (This essay is derived from talks at the 2007 
Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.) We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates.  Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had
eight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at least
four succeeded.  Three have been acquired: Reddit was a merger of
two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't
talk about yet.  Another from that batch was Loopt , which is doing
so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if
they wanted to. So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two

that fails, fails by running out of money.  It's a little misleading
to put it this way, because there's usually some other underlying
cause.  But regardless of the source of your problems, a low burn

most startups make all kinds of mistakes at first, room to recover
from mistakes is a valuable thing to have. Most startups end up doing something different than they planned.
The way the successful ones find something that works is by trying

startups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You'd

some but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead would

that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking

to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be
reluctant to invest even in good ones. You'll have to adapt to this.  But that's nothing new: startups

Q: What is the primary problem that startups in Silicon Valley face?
A: The excerpt describes a situation where startups in Silicon Valley struggle with competition, and they are often forced to choose small, obscure niches.

Q: Why does the excerpt suggest that the number of startups per capita is a key indicator of the success of startups in Silicon Valley?
A: The excerpt suggests that the number of startups per capita, combined with the overall number of startups, indicates that these startups are thriving.

invests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you
probably want to focus on your least expensive plan. If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit

number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In
most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number
of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost

The most important thing is to understand the

research process.  It is a system of

numbers.  It is a system of

"Context:  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing
from you, you won't die. That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You've probably noticed
that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders
causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every
dinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.
So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will
push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed
to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time
we talked. If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be pretty

"Context: And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans
depending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able
to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability
without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred
thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a
couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc. Different plans match different investors.  If you're talking to a
VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of
those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your
most expensive plan

Q: What is the primary recommendation for fundraising strategies, according to the excerpt?

A: The excerpt suggests that if you're talking to a VC firm that only does series A rounds, it's a waste of time to discuss plans that are not aligned with their investment goals.

Q: How does the excerpt describe the appropriate level of funding for a fundraising campaign?"
"Context: August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010 In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far. Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the average
startup fails.  When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work.  Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste

kind of anti-dilution protection do they want?  Hell if they know.
In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel

up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.  Which in practice
